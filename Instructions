Steps to set up Raspberry pi environment:
Download Raspbian Stretch with Desktop zip file: https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/
Unzip files and use an image burner software to burn the .img file onto a microSD card
When finished burning put microSD into Raspberry Pi, and plug in peripherals to the Pi, usually you'll need a mouse, monitor (HDMI), keyboard and if older Pi is used a USB wifi dongle as well as the camera module for the pi
With all peripherals plugged in, power the pi using a microUSB cable preferably through a wall charger. You should see the Pi boot up on the monitor
Follow instructions here:  https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-with-picamera  (go to the Connect the Camera Module tab)
to ensure you plug the camera in correctly and also enable the camera module when the Pi has booted. DO NOT plug or unplug the camera while the Pi is on.
Next you will want to open up a terminal window on the Pi, you will use this to install necessary packages, type into the terminal the following commands:

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
